Security Systems are necessity for Business.
It prevents theft, loss of life and provides a safer working environment as a whole.
Throughout the years security has evolved greatly from its mere beginning, now with the use of automation and cyber security, 
protection and surveillance of businesses can be activated and used with just the touch of a button, providing history of interactions and enhanced security.
For my project I built an Automated Security Door that needs clearance for entry into a specific room. 
I liked the challenge of this project as I know it can have an effective use case with many businesses such as theatres in hospitals
or file rooms holding sensitive information.

This code provides a website that takes and stores login information locally, this login information provides access to a live temperature reading page using the DHT11 sensor.
This, incorporated with an RFID reader function that accepts an RFID tag reading which allows a Servo Motor to open in conjunction with an LCD Display that provides information
on screen, welcoming the user, displaying the servos operation and displaying whether the RFID tag was accepted or not.
This is all wrapped up with a HR-S04 Ultrasonic Sensor that monitors anything that comes into range, if a user comes within the select range it then activates the RFID shield
which in turn activates the other physical components, providing a more energy efficient project as a whole.
